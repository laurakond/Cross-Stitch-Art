                    <h3>History of Cross-Stitch</h3>
                    <div class="paragraph">
                        <p>Cross stitch wasn't always a hobby. In the 18th century and as part of her preparation for
                            the responsibility of sewing clothes for her future family, girls and young women in
                            education would complete at least two stitching samplers.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Many people believe blackwork to be the origin of cross stitch. Still a very popular craft,
                            blackwork is a Spanish form of embroidery that uses black thread or silk and is worked on
                            white or off-white linen or cotton fabric.
                            This craft is believed to have been brought to England in the 16th century by Catherine of
                            Aragon when she married Henry VII in 1509. Catherine was a keen stitcher and continued to
                            make clothes for the king until her death in 1536.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Before the Industrial Revolution it was still the woman's role to make clothes for her
                            family, and so the ability to sew was a necessity. Linen was very expensive and every square
                            inch would be used up, thus the sampler was invented. Samplers were intended to teach young
                            women to sew, as well as used to help young girls to memorise numbers and the alphabet.
                            Since linen was so expensive, poorer families would use perforated paper to create their
                            designs. </p>
