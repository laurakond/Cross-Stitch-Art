(By Laura Kondrataite)

  

![Cross Stitch Art website responsiveness on various devices](documentation/am-i-responsive-all-pages.JPG)

The Cross Stitch Art is a cross-stitch portfolio website showcasing the development and progression of cross-stitch embroidery of one individual. Users will be able to read about the crafter, familiarise with the history of cross-stitch embroidery, delve into the craft of cross-stich by watching a video and view a portfolio gallery showcasing the crafter's completed and current projects. The user will also find contact information in order to get in touch with the crafter.

The website was also created for the use of the crafter to promote their portfolio, and allow to connect with peers and audiences that are interested and curious about embroidery.

The website is responsive across a range of devices, is accessible and easy to navigate for all user audiences.  

The Cross Stitch Art was primarily created for educational purposes as part of Code Institute's Web Develpment Diploma course for HTML and CSS portfolio project. However, there is scope to continue developing and making the website an active portfolio platform in the future.

## Development

### Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 


## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

## Credits 

In this section you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism. 

You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project. 

### Content 

In preparation to and during this project I refered to multiple sources, including:
- SheCodes website
- Stackoverflow website
- W3Schools website

I read up more on Media Queries functionality and watched a few videos in order to gain a better understanding of how media queries work and function:
- ![freeCodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-media-queries-breakpoints-media-types-standard-resolutions-and-more/)
- ![Dani Krossing video on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUjNEMXZA-k)
- ![WebDev Simplified channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU7jJ3NbPdA) 
- ![CSS Tricks website](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-css-media-queries/)

- The text for the Home page was taken from Wikipedia Article A
- Instructions on how to implement form validation on the Sign Up page was taken from [Specific YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/)
- The icons in the footer, and the burger menu were taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- Used Love Running project code from Code Institute for implementing drop down menu in the navigation bar, and the footer.

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
  - [HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
  - [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#General)

Getting started with your Portfolio Projects can be daunting, planning your project can make it a lot easier to tackle, take small steps to reach the final outcome and enjoy the process!
